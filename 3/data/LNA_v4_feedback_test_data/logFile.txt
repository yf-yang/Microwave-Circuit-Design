Warning detected by hpeesofsim in LinearCollapse '_2_' during analysis.
    LinearCollapse is disabled because there is 'DC' analysis present.

SP SP1[1] <3_lib:LNA_v4_feedback_test:schematic>   freq=(100 MHz->5 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis 'SP1'.
    In component `Tee4':W_widest > 5.0* W_narrowest

    In component `Tee3':W_widest > 5.0* W_narrowest

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis 'SP1'.
    UserValue(5.908150) > MaxRecommendValue(5.000000) for 'Wlargest/Wsmallest' in `Tee2'

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The simulation temperature (25.0 C) is not the same as the IEEE standard
    noise temperature (290 K or 16.85 C) in the noise analysis `SP1'.
    If the simulation temperature is not equal to the IEEE standard temperature,
    then the loss and the noise figure will not agree for a passive circuit.
    The `Temp' parameter on the Options item can be set to 16.85 C to
    eliminate this warning message.

    While evaluating `SNP3.CMP1.All':
        The provided data file doesn't cover the requested value(s) of `freq'. Therefore the required data was obtained from extrapolation.
